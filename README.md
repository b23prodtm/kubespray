You can get your invite [here](http://slack.k8s.io/)

-   Can be deployed on **AWS, GCE, Azure, OpenStack, vSphere, Packet (bare metal), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (Experimental), or Baremetal**
-   **Highly available** cluster
-   **Composable** (Choice of the network plugin for instance)
-   Supports most popular **Linux distributions**
-   **Continuous integration tests**

Quick Start
-----------

To deploy the cluster you can use :

### Ansible with Raspberry Pis cluster
~~Raspian 9 (arm, armv7l) is installed on PIs systems.~~ Ubuntu 18.04 bionic preinstalled server for Raspberries, [Download and flash the classic Server for ARM64](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi). Also for Raspberry see current Pull Requests:

- [ARM](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/pull/4261)
- [ARM64](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/pull/4171)

#### Ansible version

Ansible v2.7.0's failing and/or produce unexpected results due to [ansible/ansible/issues/46600](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46600)

#### Usage

    # Install pip [from python](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/)
    sudo python get-pip.py

    # Install dependencies from ``requirements.txt``
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Copy ``inventory/sample`` as ``inventory/mycluster``
    cp -rfp inventory/sample inventory/mycluster

    # Update Ansible inventory file with inventory builder . Single master IP is possible, see nodes with bastion
    declare -a IPS=(192.168.0.16 192.168.0.17)
    CONFIG_FILE=inventory/mycluster/hosts.ini python contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py ${IPS[@]}
    cat inventory/mycluster/hosts.ini
    # bastion single master looks like `raspberrypi ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.16 ip=192.168.0.16` ansible_host=192.168.0.16  ansible_user=pi" # replace 'pi' with 'ubuntu' or any other user
    # Review and change parameters under ``inventory/mycluster/group_vars``
    cat inventory/mycluster/group_vars/all/all.yml
    cat inventory/mycluster/group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml

    declare PI=pi # replace 'pi' with 'ubuntu' or any other user
    for ip in ${IPS[@]}; do
    # You can ssh-copy-id to Ansible inventory hosts permanently for the pi user
      ssh-copy-id $PI@$ip;    
      ssh $PI@$ip sudo bash -c "echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config";
      ssh $PI@$ip cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep PermitRootLogin;
     # To install etcd on nodes, Go lang is needed
      ssh $PI@$ip sudo apt-get install golang -y;
     # Ansible is reported as a trusted repository
      ssh $PI@$ip sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367;
     # deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu trusty main

    # The kube user which owns k8s daemons must be added to Ubuntu group.
      ssh $PI@$pi sudo usermod -a -G ubuntu kube;

    # disable firewall for the setup
      ssh $PI@$pi sudo ufw disable;
    done

    # Adjust the ansible_memtotal_mb to your Raspberry specs
    cat roles/kubernetes/preinstall/tasks/0020-verify-settings.yml | grep -b2 'that: ansible_memtotal_mb'

    # Shortcut to actually set up the playbook on hosts:
    scripts/my_playbook.sh cluster.yml

    # Displays help scripts/my_playbook.sh --help
    # or you can use the extended version as well
    # scripts/my_playbook.sh -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.ini cluster.yml

    for ip in ${IPS[@]}; do
    # --setup-firewall opens default kubernetes ports in firewalld
      scripts/my_playbook.sh --setup-firewall $PI@$pi
      ssh $PI@$pi sudo ufw enable;        
    done

See [Ansible](docs/ansible.md) documentation. Ansible uses tags to define TASK groups management.

>Note: When Ansible's already installed via system packages on the control machine, other python packages installed via `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` will go to a different directory tree (e.g. `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` on Ubuntu) from Ansible's (e.g. `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible` still on Ubuntu).
As a consequence, `ansible-playbook` command will fail with:
```
ERROR! no action detected in task. This often indicates a misspelled module name, or incorrect module path.
```
probably pointing on a task depending on a module present in requirements.txt (i.e. "unseal vault").

One way of solving this would be to uninstall the Ansible package and then, to install it via pip but it is not always possible.
A workaround consists of setting `ANSIBLE_LIBRARY` and `ANSIBLE_MODULE_UTILS` environment variables respectively to the `ansible/modules` and `ansible/module_utils` subdirectories of pip packages installation location, which can be found in the Location field of the output of `pip show [package]` before executing `ansible-playbook`.

#### Known issues :
See [docs](./docs/ansible.md)

- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ruamel'
```Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py", line 36, in <module>
    from ruamel.yaml import YAML
```
Please install inventory builder python libraries.
>  sudo pip install -r contrib/inventory_builder/requirements.txt

- CGROUPS_MEMORY missing to use ```kubeadm init```

    [ERROR SystemVerification]: missing cgroups: memory

The Linux kernel must be loaded with special cgroups enabled. Add the following to the kernel parameters:

    cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1

E.g. : Raspberry Ubuntu Preinstalled server uses u-boot, then in ssh session run as regular user with sudo privileges:

    sed "$ s/$/ cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1/" /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt | sudo tee /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
    reboot

- I may not be able to build a playbook on Arm, armv7l architectures Issues with systems such as Rasbian 9 and the Raspberries first and second generation. There's [some issue](http://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/4261) to obtain 32 bits binary compatibility on those systems. Please post a comment if you find a way to enable 32 bits support for the k8s stack.

- Kubeadm 1.10.1 known to feature arm64 binary in googlestorage.io

- When you see the Error : no PUBKEY ... could be received from GPG Look at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-debian

- Deploy Kubespray with Ansible Playbook to raspberrypi The option -b is required, as for example writing SSL keys in /etc/, installing packages and interacting with various systemd daemons. Without -b argument the playbook would fall to start !

ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.ini cluster.yml -b -v --become-user=root --private-key=~/.ssh/id_rsa

- ```scripts/my_playbook.sh```

        "changed": false,
        "evaluated_to": false,
        "msg": "Assertion failed"
    }

The host *ip* set in ```inventory/<mycluster>/hosts.ini``` isn't the docker network interface (iface). Run with ssh@... terminal : ```ifconfig docker0``` to find the ipv4 address that's attributed to the docker0 iface. E.g. _172.17.0.1_

The inventory/<mycluster>/hosts.ini file [kube-node] or [kube-master] was empty. They cannot be the same. That assertion means that a kubernetes cluster is made of at least one kube-master and one kube-node.

- Error:  open /etc/ssl/etcd/ssl/admin-<hostname>.pem: permission denied

The file located at /etc/ssl/etcd's owned by another user than Ubuntu and cannot be accessed by Ansible. Please change the file owner:group to ```ubuntu:ubuntu``` or the *ansible_user* or your choice.

      ssh <ansible_user>@<bastion-ip> 'sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu -R /etc/ssl/etcd/'

Kubernetes container manager failed to resolve package reposirory hostnames. That's related to the cluster DNS misconfiguration. Read the [DNS Stack](docs/dns-stack.md) documentation. You may opt in for a dnsmasq_kubedns dns mode, your master host must have access to the internet. Default Google DNS IPs are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. A DNS service must be running, see below.

- How much memory is left free on my master host ?
If you don't know how much memory's available for the master host kubernetes-apps, run the following command that displays live memory usage :

      ssh $PI@$pi top
      # Ctrl-C to stop monitoring

- Timeout (12s) waiting for privilege escalation prompt
Try increasing the timeout settings, you may want to run ansible with
      ``--timeout=45`` and add ``--ask-become-pass`` (that's asking sudo password).

If the error still happens, the ansible roles/ specific TASK configuration should set up the privileges escalation. Please contact the system administrator and [fill in an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues) about the TASK that must be fixed up.

- How to open firewall ports for <master-node-ip> ?

      ./scripts/my_playbook.sh --firewall-setup $PI@<master-node-ip>

### Vagrant

For Vagrant we need to install python dependencies for provisioning tasks.
Check if python and pip are installed:

    python -V && pip -V

If this returns the version of the software, you're good to go. If not, download and install Python from here <https://www.python.org/downloads/source/>
Install the necessary requirements

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    vagrant up

Note: The list of validated [docker versions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.13.md) was updated to 1.11.1, 1.12.1, 1.13.1, 17.03, 17.06, 17.09, 18.06. kubeadm now properly recognizes Docker 18.09.0 and newer, but still treats 18.06 as the default supported version. The kubelet might break on docker's non-standard version numbering (it no longer uses semantic versioning). To ensure auto-updates don't break your cluster look into e.g. yum versionlock plugin or apt pin).

Note 2: rkt support as docker alternative's limited to control plane (etcd and
kubelet). Docker's still used for Kubernetes cluster workloads and network
plugins' related OS services. Also note, only one of the supported network
plugins can be deployed for a given single cluster.

Requirements
------------

-   **Ansible v2.6 (or newer) and python-netaddr's installed on the machine
    that will run Ansible commands**
-   **Jinja 2.9 (or newer)'s required to run the Ansible Playbooks**
-   The target servers must have **access to the Internet** in order to pull docker images. Otherwise, additional configuration's required (See [Offline Environment](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/downloads.md#offline-environment))
-   The target servers are configured to allow **IPv4 forwarding**.
-   **Your ssh key must be copied** to all the servers part of your inventory.
-   The **firewalls are not managed**, you'll need to implement your own rules the way you used to.
    in order to avoid any issue during deployment you should disable your firewall.
-   If kubespray's ran from non-root user account, correct privilege escalation method
    should be configured in the target servers. Then the `ansible_become` flag
    or command parameters `--become or -b` should be specified.

Hardware:        
These limits are safe guarded by Kubespray. Actual requirements for your workload can differ. For a sizing guide go to the [Building Large Clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/cluster-large/#size-of-master-and-master-components) guide.

-   Master
    - Memory: 1500 MB
-   Node
    - Memory: 1024 MB

Network Plugins
---------------

You can choose between 6 network plugins. (default: `calico`, except Vagrant uses `flannel`)

-   [flannel](docs/flannel.md): gre/vxlan (layer 2) networking.

-   [calico](docs/calico.md): bgp (layer 3) networking.

-   [canal](https://github.com/projectcalico/canal): a composition of calico and flannel plugins.

-   [cilium](http://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/): layer 3/4 networking (as well as layer 7 to protect and secure application protocols), supports dynamic insertion of BPF bytecode into the Linux kernel to implement security services, networking and visibility logic.

-   [contiv](docs/contiv.md): supports vlan, vxlan, bgp and Cisco SDN networking. This plugin's able to
    apply firewall policies, segregate containers in multiple network and bridging pods onto physical networks.

-   [weave](docs/weave.md): Weave's a lightweight container overlay network that doesn't require an external K/V database cluster.
    (Please refer to `weave` [troubleshooting documentation](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/troubleshooting.html)).

-   [kube-router](docs/kube-router.md): Kube-router's a L3 CNI for Kubernetes networking aiming to provide operational
    simplicity and high performance: it uses IPVS to provide Kube Services Proxy (if setup to replace kube-proxy),
    iptables for network policies, and BGP for ods L3 networking (with optionally BGP peering with out-of-cluster BGP peers).
    It can also optionally advertise routes to Kubernetes cluster Pods CIDRs, ClusterIPs, ExternalIPs and LoadBalancerIPs.

-   [multus](docs/multus.md): Multus's a meta CNI plugin that provides multiple network interface support to pods. For each interface Multus delegates CNI calls to secondary CNI plugins such as Calico, macvlan, etc.

The choice's defined with the variable `kube_network_plugin`. There's also an
option to leverage built-in cloud provider networking instead.
See also [Network checker](docs/netcheck.md).
